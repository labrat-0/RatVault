## Log Locations

Windows event logs are stored in the following locations:

```
# Main event log files (.evtx)
%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\

# Security log
%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Security.evtx

# System log
%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\System.evtx

# Application log
%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Application.evtx

# PowerShell operational log
%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational.evtx

# Sysmon log (if installed)
%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon%4Operational.evtx
```

## Event Viewer Usage

Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`) is the built-in GUI tool for viewing Windows event logs:

| Action | Steps |
|--------|-------|
| Open specific log | Event Viewer â†’ Windows Logs â†’ Security/System/Application |
| Filter by Event ID | Right-click log â†’ Filter Current Log â†’ Event ID: 4624,4625 |
| Filter by time | Right-click log â†’ Filter Current Log â†’ Time range |
| Create custom view | Right-click Custom Views â†’ Create Custom View |
| Export logs | Right-click log â†’ Save Filtered Log File As... |
| Clear log | Right-click log â†’ Clear Log |

> [!warning] Clearing logs requires administrator privileges and may destroy evidence. In forensic investigations, always preserve original logs.

## PowerShell For Log Analysis

### Query Security Logons
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -FilterXPath "*[System[(EventID=4624)]]" -MaxEvents 10 | 
    Format-Table TimeCreated, @{Name='User';Expression={$_.Properties[5].Value}}
```

### Find Failed Logon Attempts
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4625} | 
    Select-Object TimeCreated, @{Name='Username';Expression={$_.Properties[5].Value}}, 
                  @{Name='Source';Expression={$_.Properties[19].Value}}
```

### Detect Account Lockouts
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4740} | 
    Select-Object TimeCreated, @{Name='Username';Expression={$_.Properties[0].Value}}
```

### Check for Privilege Escalation
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4672} | 
    Select-Object TimeCreated, @{Name='Username';Expression={$_.Properties[1].Value}}
```

### Search for Process Creation
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4688} | 
    Select-Object TimeCreated, @{Name='Process';Expression={$_.Properties[5].Value}},
                  @{Name='User';Expression={$_.Properties[1].Value}}
```

### Convert EVTX to CSV
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -Path C:\Path\to\log.evtx | Export-Csv -Path output.csv -NoTypeInformation
```

### Combine Multiple Event IDs
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; ID=4624,4625,4634} -MaxEvents 100
```

## Common Attack Patterns

### Pass-the-Hash Detection
Look for:
- Event ID 4624 (Logon) with Logon Type 3 or 9
- Where Authentication Package is NTLM rather than Kerberos
- Multiple logons from admin accounts across systems

### Brute Force Attacks
Look for:
- Multiple Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon) for same username
- Failed logons from same source IP/computer
- Pattern of attempts across multiple accounts

### Lateral Movement
Look for:
- Event ID 4624 (Logon) with Logon Type 3 (Network) or 10 (RDP)
- Event ID 4688 with process names like psexec.exe, wmic.exe, sc.exe, schtasks.exe
- Event ID 5140 (Network Share Access) to admin shares (C$, ADMIN$)

### Privilege Escalation
Look for:
- Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned)
- Event ID 4732 (User added to privileged group)
- Event ID 4688 with UAC bypass techniques (eventvwr.exe then abnormal child)
- PowerShell events with suspicious scripts

### Persistence Mechanisms
Look for:
- Event ID 4698 (Scheduled Task creation)
- Event ID 4697 (Service installation)
- Event ID 4657 (Registry modifications) to Run keys, Services, WMI subscriptions

### Credential Theft
Look for:
- Event ID 4688 with process names like mimikatz.exe, procdump.exe
- Event ID 4663 (Object access) to LSASS process
- Events showing access to SAM, SECURITY registry hives

### Log Tampering
Look for:
- Event ID 1102 (Security log cleared)
- Event ID 104 (Log cleared)
- Missing time periods in logs
- Disabled audit policies (Event ID 4719)
