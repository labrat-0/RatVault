## Guide Components

Each tool guide typically includes:

1. **Basic Operation**: Getting started with the tool (installation, configuration)
2. **Key Use Cases**: Most common security-focused scenarios
3. **Advanced Techniques**: More complex analysis methods
4. **Command Reference**: Quick reference for common commands
5. **Output Interpretation**: How to understand and analyze results
6. **Scripting & Automation**: Ways to extend and automate the tool

## Guide Design Philosophy

These guides are designed with these principles in mind:

1. **Task-oriented**: Organized around specific security tasks rather than features
2. **Visual learning**: Screenshots and diagrams to illustrate key concepts
3. **Practical examples**: Real-world usage scenarios with sample data
4. **Progressive complexity**: Start with basics and build to advanced topics
5. **Integration focus**: How tools work together in a security workflow

## Customization

Feel free to enhance these guides:

- Add organization-specific usage patterns
- Include custom scripts or extensions you've developed
- Link to internal datasets or test cases
- Add notes on tool limitations in your environment

> [!tip] Tool Documentation Best Practices
> 1. Document the exact version of tools used in examples
> 2. Include command syntax for both CLI and GUI options when available
> 3. Maintain a section for common errors and their solutions
> 4. Show sample outputs to help readers verify correct usage
> 5. Link to official documentation for comprehensive reference
